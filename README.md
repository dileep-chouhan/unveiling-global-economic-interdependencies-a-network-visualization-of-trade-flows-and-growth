# Unveiling Global Economic Interdependencies: A Network Visualization of Trade Flows and Growth

## Overview

This project visualizes the intricate relationships within the global economy by analyzing trade flows and GDP growth rates across countries.  The analysis aims to identify key economic relationships, potential vulnerabilities, and dependencies between nations.  The visualization utilizes network graph techniques to represent trade connections, with node size and color reflecting GDP growth and trade volume, respectively. This allows for a dynamic and interactive exploration of global economic interconnectedness.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NetworkX (likely, depending on the chosen visualization method)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will process the data and generate the visualizations.

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key statistics about trade flows and GDP growth correlations.  Additionally, it will generate an interactive visualization (likely a network graph) saved as `global_economic_network.html` (or a similar filename depending on the chosen visualization library). This HTML file can be opened in any web browser to explore the interactive visualization of global economic interdependencies.  The specific output may vary depending on the data used and the chosen visualization methods.
